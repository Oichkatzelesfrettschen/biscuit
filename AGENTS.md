# Agent Instructions

All code changes must use modern language paradigms and idiomatic style. Functions must be documented using Doxygen-compatible comments detailing purpose, parameters, return values, and global variables. When modifying code, apply formatting and prettification but leave comment-only changes unformatted. Integrate Doxygen with Sphinx using Breathe for documentation builds aimed at Read the Docs.
