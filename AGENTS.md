# Agent Instructions

All code changes must use modern language paradigms and idiomatic style. Functions must be documented using Doxygen-compatible comments detailing purpose, parameters, return values, and global variables. When modifying code, apply formatting and prettification but leave comment-only changes unformatted. Integrate Doxygen with Sphinx using Breathe for documentation builds aimed at Read the Docs.

All modifications must further decompose, unroll, flatten, factor and synthesize the code into modern idiomatic expressions guided by mathematical principles wherever possible.
